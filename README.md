* Storytelling in PowerPoint https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CY1Y367KEko
  * SCR/SCQA framework
  * Situation (What is the situation and why is this important?)
  * Complication (What is the problem? What went wrong? Has a trend or cause been identified?)
  * Question (Usually implied - What should we do about it?)
  * Resolution (What is the solution?)
* The Pyramid principle https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G88Xvr3yBLQ&t=188s
  * Start with the answer
  * Follow up with your arguments (Arguments follow the SCR framework)
  * Supply supporting data for arguments
* One rule every slide must follow (Golden Rule of Slide Building) https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xzRXmn58aRk
  * Lead in (text at top of slide) should describe the "so what" of slide.
  * Slide body should support the action title (nothing else)
  * No additional data besides what is needed to support the action title should be in the slide body
  * Golden Rule: One slide has one message, articulated in the action title and fully supported by the slide body
* Three rules for writing perfect slide action titles https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2EgczbPJB14&t=162s
  * Action title talks about the implication or "so what" of the slide.
  * It makes it faster to understand the key point
  * It helps avoid misunderstanding (getting the wrong key point)
  * Focus on the "so what" or the implication
  * Be specific and narrow (instead of general and broad) (SMART)
  * As few words as possible
* PowerPoint Flow https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wZH_n-_yl-I
